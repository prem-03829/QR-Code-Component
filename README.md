## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

- Using semantic elements like main, h1 and p
- Applying CSS variables to keep colors consistent
- Centering content using Flexbox
- Adding smooth hover effects and subtle shadows
- Matching a design more precisely by adjusting spacing and roundingely

```html
  <h1 class="title">
    Improve your front-end skills by building projects
  </h1>
```
```css
.container {
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving:
- Layout precision: matching designs more pixel-perfect
- Responsive behavior: using media queries more confidently
- Accessibility: improving alt text, roles, and structure
- Even small components like this are great practice for clean code habits.
- Writing cleaner, more scalable CSS

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS course](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=7YR5vK1qGlj99kkb) - A great beginner-friendly introduction to HTML and CSS. It helped reinforce core concepts I used in this challenge.
